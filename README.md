This code was run in Qt Creator (we were having problems building it elsewhere). 
To run, click the run button. 

Additionally, update the file path of the TrimmedData.csv file to match whatever it is in your machine. As it is, the file path was for bdang831's file path. 

Since Qt creator seemed to be having issues with user input, the input must be hard-coded. Simply change the state and string counties (lines 69 and 70).
